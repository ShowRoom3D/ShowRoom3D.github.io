            We introduce ShowRoom3D, a three-stage approach for
            generating high-quality 3D room-scale scenes from texts.
            Previous methods using 2D diffusion priors to optimize neu-
            ral radiance fields for generating room-scale scenes have
            shown unsatisfactory quality. This is primarily attributed to
            the limitations of 2D priors lacking 3D awareness and con-
            straints in the training methodology. In this paper, we utilize a 3D diffusion prior, MVDiffusion, to optimize the 3D room-
            scale scene. Our contributions are in two aspects. Firstly,
            we propose a progressive view selection process to optimize
            NeRF. This involves dividing the training process into three
            stages, gradually expanding the camera sampling scope.
            Secondly, we propose the pose transformation method in
            the second stage. It will ensure MVDiffusion provide the
            accurate view guidance. As a result, ShowRoom3D enables
            the generation of rooms with improved structural integrity,
            enhanced clarity from any view, reduced content repetition, and higher consistency across different perspectives. Exten-
            sive experiments demonstrate that our method, significantly
            outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin
            in terms of user study.
